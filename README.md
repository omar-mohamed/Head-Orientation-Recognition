# Head-Orientation-Recognition
Head pose gives information about what someone is paying attention to, and as such is important for social interaction and for mediating learning. Estimating head pose is an active area of research in computer vision. The goal of this project is to train a neural network to classify the orientation of a centered image of a head as either left, right, or front.
